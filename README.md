# Simulation-Planets

A fun little simulation of planet orbits.
Inspired by the three body problem.

Java program using the external library ACM.jar as graphics library.

Notes:
 - No issues encountered during testing.
 - Planets Earth and Moon(instance of Planet class, could have named it celestialBody) are initialized with realistic parameters but Mars is obviously not.
 - Earth and Moon orbital simulation is somewhat stable (short testing). Mars' is not.
 - Y-axis is mirrored (up is down and down is up)
 - Presence of some arbitrary parameters such as deltaTime, physicsTime, density, scale, etc.
